# Greetings, candidate!

As part of our recruitment process, we have a step where you can perform a programming task. The purpose of the task is not that it should be technically challenging, but rather that it should give us insight into your problem-solving ability. What we will assess when we review your solution is:

<ul>
<li>Design</li>
<li>Structure</li>
<li>Readability</li>
<li>Testability</li>
<li>How easy is your code to maintain</li>
</ul>

## Reporting your result: 
When you have completed the task, please provide us with a link to (GitHub, Dropbox, Google Drive) or add a pull request to this repository. No later than a week before after you have received the assignment.

## Tech: 
To solve the task, we would like you to use either (React, Angular or Vue,js). Your task is to design a client web application (you have the option to add a server application too) that helps the user to choose the right length of cross-country skis. Choose to put emphasis on the part you prefer to work with, if you prefer client side development, you put an extra focus there or vice versa.

## Requirements specification: 

<ul>
<li>The application must have a user interface (simple or detailed) that is mobile friendly.</li> 
<li>The application must communicate between client and server (use a mock if you wont create a server application).</li>
<li>The user must specify:
<ul>
<li>Body length</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Classic or Freestyle</li>
</ul>
</ul>

## Recommendations when calculating ski length:

<ul>
<li>Children 0-4 years: body length + 0 cm.</li> 
<li>Children 5-8 years: body length + 10 to 20 cm.</li>
<li>Classic: body length + 20cm. Classic skis are only made for lengths up to 207cm.</li> 
<li>Freestyle: body length +10 to 15 cm. According to the competition rules, the ski must not be less than 10 cm below the body length.</li>
</ul>

# Good luck!
